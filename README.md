# my_Shiny_app
This page is for showing a R Shiny app that I have developed while collaborating with the Data Analysis Group at the Univerity of Dundee.

This app is integrated in the R package Proteus, currently developed by [Dr Marek Gierlinski](https://twitter.com/MarekGierlinski).

Background
==========
To incorporate the R package with _live features, the main developer asked me to transform a couple of method in R Shiny.

Instructions
============

Download the repo on your local machine. The demo will use the files contained in the `data` folder.
Some editing could be necessary at the beginning of the `app.R` file to point to the correct location of the demo data.
